# Movie Recommendation System

## **Overview**
This project builds a **Movie Recommendation System** using various machine learning algorithms. It involves data preprocessing, merging datasets, and implementing different recommendation methods.

## **Datasets Used**
The project utilizes the following **original datasets**:

1. **ratings.csv** - Contains user ratings for movies.
2. **movies.csv** - Includes movie titles and metadata.
3. **tmdb_5000_movies.csv** - Provides additional movie details from TMDB.
4. **tmdb_5000_credits.zip** - Contains cast and crew information.

## **Data Merging Process**
- The datasets were merged based on the **"movieId"** column.
- After merging, the data was consolidated into two main files:
  1. **merged_movie.csv** - Contains the combined movie metadata.
  2. **merged_ratings.csv** - Holds the merged ratings data.

The data merging process is fully documented in the Jupyter Notebook.

## **Implementation**
The Jupyter Notebook **"Movie Recommendation System"** contains:
- The entire data preprocessing workflow.
- The **merging process** for combining datasets.
- Machine learning algorithms implemented for different **recommendation techniques**:
	- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
	- Linear Regression
	- Random Forest
	- Gradient Boosting
	- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)


## **How to Use**
1. Open the **"Movie Recommendation System"** Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the **data preprocessing** and merging steps.
3. Experiment with different recommendation algorithms implemented in the notebook.

## **Next Steps**
- Further improve recommendation accuracy using **hybrid methods**.
- Experiment with **deep learning approaches** for better personalization.
- Optimize computational efficiency for large datasets.
